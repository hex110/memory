Describe what's happening in this moment of the user's work session:

CURRENT ACTIVITY:
Timestamp: {{timestamp}}
Duration: {{duration}} seconds
Window Activity:
{{window_summaries}}

Interaction Metrics:
- Keys: {{total_keys}}
- Clicks: {{total_clicks}}
- Scrolls: {{total_scrolls}}

{% if screenshot_available %}
A screenshot of the current state is available for reference.
{% endif %}

{% if previous_logs %}
RECENT CONTEXT:
{{previous_logs}}  # Last 2 logs
{% endif %}

Provide a 1-2 sentence observation that captures what the user is actually working on, not just which windows are open. Consider:
- What task or goal they appear to be pursuing
- How this moment connects to their recent activity
- Any meaningful changes in their work
- Visual context from the screenshot if available

Focus on building understanding of their work session, not just rephrasing window data.
