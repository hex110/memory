Observe and describe the current activity snapshot:

CURRENT ACTIVITY:
Timestamp: {{timestamp}}
Duration: {{duration}} seconds
Window Activity: {{window_summaries}}
Interaction Metrics:
- Keys: {{total_keys}}
- Clicks: {{total_clicks}}
- Scrolls: {{total_scrolls}}

{% if previous_logs %}
RECENT CONTEXT:
{{previous_logs}}  # Last 2 activity logs
{% endif %}

Provide a 1-2 sentence observation that captures:
- The specific task or work currently in focus
- How it relates to or differs from recent activity
- Any notable changes in work context or focus
- Details that help understand what the user is trying to accomplish

Keep your response clear and descriptive, focusing on what's happening rather than evaluating it. Aim to provide rich context that will be valuable for later analysis of the work session.
