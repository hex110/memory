**SESSION ANALYSIS REQUEST:**
Please provide a standard post-session analysis focused on actionable workflow improvements.

Based on the session data, address the following key areas to generate actionable insights:

1. **Identify "What Worked Well" in this Session (Patterns to Maintain):**
    - Highlight specific work patterns, strategies, or moments in the session that were particularly effective or productive.
    - What can the user *repeat* or *reinforce* in future sessions?

2. **Identify "What Could Be Improved" (Challenges to Address):**
    - Point out specific challenges, inefficiencies, distractions, or less effective work patterns observed during the session.
    - What are the key areas the user should *focus on improving* in future sessions?

3. **Provide "Specific Recommendations for the Next Session" (Actionable Next Steps):**
    - Based on your analysis of "What Worked Well" and "What Could Be Improved," provide concrete, actionable recommendations for the *very next work session*.
    - These should be clear, practical steps the user can *immediately implement* to optimize their workflow.

Structure your output clearly under these three headings: "What Worked Well," "What Could Be Improved," and "Specific Recommendations for the Next Session." Aim for concise and directly actionable insights under each heading.
