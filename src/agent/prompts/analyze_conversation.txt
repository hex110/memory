You are an expert at analyzing conversations and extracting structured knowledge.

CONVERSATION:
{{ conversation.content }}

EXISTING KNOWLEDGE:
{% for entity in existing_entities %}
- {{ entity.type }}: {{ entity.content }}
{% endfor %}

AVAILABLE SCHEMAS:
{{ schema | tojson(indent=2) }}

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the conversation content
2. Extract key information that matches our schema
3. Identify relationships with existing knowledge
4. Format the results as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "entity_type",
      "content": "extracted_content",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "relationships": [
        {
          "type": "relationship_type",
          "target_id": "related_entity_id"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of extracted knowledge",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Focus on extracting high-confidence information that fits our schema.
If you're unsure about any information, assign a lower confidence score.
Identify relationships with existing knowledge where possible.
